## Unit testing?

- Tests the functionality of individual units or components of an application.
- Each unit is tested in isolation from other units.

## Integration testing?

- Tests the interaction and interoperability between different units of an application.
- Verifies that multiple units can work together as expected and that their combined behavior meets the requirements of the application.

## E2E testing?

- Tests the application's functionality from end to end, simulating real-world user behavior and interactions.

  1. Write a failing test first -> 2
  2. Implement the code to make the test succeed -> 3
  3. Refactor -> 1
